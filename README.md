#### * Interview tasks, some were rejected, some were not checked. I provided tasks I was given in readme files.

### I also develop telegram bots and familiar with python-telegram-bot and aiogram libraries. 

#### I don't have any finished bots yet, but this is my current main projects:

#### [SaraBot](https://github.com/SaraFarron/SaraBot) - Bot that will help improve english vocabulary. Users will be able to upload gheet files that google translator generates or add words manualy and than learn on everyday basis. Expected stack of technologies: aiogram, postgresql, celery (for notifications), docker

#### [youtube-bot](https://github.com/SaraFarron/youtube-bot) - Imagine if you want to subsribe not to youtube channel for all the videos author creates, but only some of them. This bot will (try to) solve this problem. You can send link to youtube channel and then keyword or regex, and if video with such pattern appears on channel, it will send you a link. Expected stack of technologies: aiogram, postgresql, celery (for updating last videos), docker, google api client.
